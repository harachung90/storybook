        <p>The Monk Diamond is famous for its distinctive green colour. A Russian nobleman bought
            the diamond for his wife in 1889, but it was stolen during the Russian Revolution. For
            the next 30 years, the Monk Diamond’s whereabouts were unknown. In 1947 it was
            discovered during a police raid on a gang of petty criminals in Moscow. It was returned
            to the nobleman’s family. The nobleman’s son decided the Monk Diamond was unlucky
            and sold it to the House of Volkov, Moscow’s oldest jewellery house. The House of Volkov
            paid an undisclosed sum for the jewel, but it was rumoured to be the most expensive
            diamond sale ever.</p>
