        <p>Professor Bairstone and Dr Day, along with Ernest the dog, were on an
            expedition in Siberia when they discovered the Monk Diamond. It had
            been hidden in a remote mountain cave. The Bond Brothers attempted to
            sabotage the expedition and reclaim the diamond but were unsuccessful.
            The team returned to Moscow with the diamond and a special exhibition is
            being held at the House of Volkov to celebrate their discovery.</p>
